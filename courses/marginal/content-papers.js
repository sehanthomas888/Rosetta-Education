  blurb: 'The paper that turned diversification from folk wisdom into mathematics.',
  level: 'Accessible', min: 20, tags: ['portfolio theory', 'diversification'],
  plain: 'Before this paper, "don\'t put all your eggs in one basket" was just a saying. Markowitz showed that the right question is not "which single investment is best?" but "which <em>combination</em> is best?", because how investments move <em>together</em> matters as much as how each one does alone. He turned that into a method, and it is the starting point of modern investing theory.',
  los: [
    'Explain why maximizing expected return alone leads to putting everything in one asset.',
    'Say why a portfolio\'s risk depends on how its assets move together, not just on each asset\'s own risk.',
    'Describe the efficient frontier and the main practical problem with the method.'
  ],
  terms: [
    ['Expected return', 'the average outcome you would expect'],
    ['Variance', 'a measure of how much returns vary around their average (standard deviation squared)'],
    ['Covariance', 'how two assets\' returns move together'],
    ['Efficient frontier', 'the set of portfolios with the highest expected return for each level of risk'],
    ['Law of large numbers', 'the idea that random ups and downs average out when you have many independent bets']
  ],
  question: 'How should an investor choose among risky securities when returns are uncertain? The dominant view at the time held that you should simply maximize the discounted expected return, which would mean putting everything into the single highest-yielding asset. Yet nobody actually invests that way.',
  idea: 'Investors care about both <b>expected return</b> and <b>risk (variance)</b>. Because security returns move together to some degree, a portfolio\'s risk depends on how securities move <em>with each other</em> (covariances), not just on each one\'s own risk. Diversification works, but only up to a point: it cannot remove risk that is common to all assets. For each level of risk there is a portfolio with the maximum expected return, and the set of these is the <b>efficient frontier</b>.',
  method: 'Mostly theoretical and geometric. Markowitz works through small examples with three and four securities, plotting the feasible portfolios and showing how the efficient set is traced out. There is no big dataset. He explicitly leaves the estimation of inputs to statistics and judgment and focuses on what an investor should do <em>given</em> those beliefs.',
  example: '<p>Suppose you have two stocks with the same expected return. Stock A and Stock B each swing a lot on their own. If they tend to rise and fall <em>together</em>, mixing them barely helps. If one tends to rise when the other falls, mixing them cancels much of the swing, so you get the same expected return with much less risk. That is the whole insight: it is the relationship between the two, the covariance, that matters. (The <a href="#/lesson/risk">risk lesson</a> works through the numbers.)</p><p>The practical burden is also visible here: every <em>pair</em> of securities needs its own covariance estimated, and the number of pairs grows faster than the number of securities. With 4 securities (A, B, C, D), list every pair: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD — 6 pairs, not 4 × 4 = 16, because AB and BA are the same pair counted once. The counting shortcut: each of the <i>n</i> securities can be paired with the other <i>n</i> − 1, giving <i>n</i>(<i>n</i> − 1) pairings, but that counts every pair twice (once as AB, once as BA) — so divide by 2.</p><table class="steps"><tr><td>4 securities: each pairs with 3 others</td><td>4 × 3 = 12</td></tr><tr><td>÷ 2, since AB and BA are the same pair</td><td>12 ÷ 2 = 6</td></tr><tr class="tot"><td>50 securities: 50 × 49 ÷ 2</td><td>1,225 covariances</td></tr></table>',
  findings: 'A rational investor should not maximize expected return alone. Portfolios can be ranked by an expected return–variance trade-off, and diversification lowers variance without reducing the expected return. The law of large numbers alone does not eliminate portfolio variance, because securities\' returns are positively correlated.',
  matters: 'Founding paper of modern portfolio theory. It moved the unit of analysis from the security to the portfolio, and it is the direct foundation for CAPM (see Sharpe, 1964). Markowitz shared the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics.',
  critique: 'Estimation error is the practical Achilles heel: optimizers treat noisy expected-return estimates as truth and load up on assets with overestimated returns (Michaud called this "error maximization"). DeMiguel, Garlappi and Uppal (2009) found the naive 1/N portfolio often beats optimized portfolios out of sample. Variance also treats upside and downside surprises symmetrically, and it assumes a single period.',

  level: 'Moderate', min: 25, tags: ['CAPM', 'equilibrium'],
  plain: 'Markowitz told one investor how to build a portfolio. Sharpe asked: if <em>everyone</em> does that, what happens to prices? His answer: everyone ends up holding the same basket of risky assets (the whole market), and the extra return an asset offers depends only on how much it moves with the market, its beta. Risk that has nothing to do with the market is not rewarded, because you can diversify it away for free.',

    ['Capital market line', 'the line of best combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio']
  ],
  question: 'Markowitz described what one investor should do. Sharpe asks the next question: if <em>all</em> investors behave that way, what determines the price of risk in the market, and how should an individual asset\'s expected return relate to its risk?',
  idea: 'Assume investors share the same beliefs and can borrow and lend freely at a risk-free rate. Then they all hold the same portfolio of risky assets (the market portfolio), differing only in how much they lever or de-lever it. In equilibrium, an asset\'s expected return rises linearly with its <b>beta</b>, its sensitivity to the overall market. Risk unrelated to the market is not rewarded.',
  method: 'A theoretical equilibrium model. Sharpe lays out explicit assumptions (single period, mean–variance investors, common expectations, one risk-free rate for lending and borrowing) and derives the market-wide relationship. Lintner (1965) and Mossin (1966) reached the same result independently; Treynor had an unpublished version earlier.',
  example: '<p>Take a risk-free rate of 3%, a market premium of 5% and a stock with beta 1.4. The model says its expected return should be 3% + 1.4 × 5% = <b>10%</b>. A stock with beta 0.6 should offer 3% + 0.6 × 5% = <b>6%</b>. A stock that is very risky on its own but has a beta of 0.6 still only needs to offer 6%, because the market does not pay for the part of the risk you can diversify away.</p>',
  findings: 'The capital market line shows the trade-off for efficient portfolios, and the relationship for individual assets, later called the security market line, ties expected return to beta. Sharpe frames it as two prices: the <em>price of time</em> (the risk-free rate) and the <em>price of risk</em> (the extra return per unit of market exposure).',

  critique: 'Roll (1977) argued the theory cannot be truly tested because the market portfolio includes all assets and is not observable. Empirically, early tests (Black, Jensen and Scholes, 1972) found a flatter line than predicted, and Fama and French (1992) found beta did not explain average returns across stocks.

Then classify the tests by the information set used: <b>weak</b> (past prices), <b>semi-strong</b> (all public information) and <b>strong</b> (all information, including private). Efficiency is framed as a "fair game": after accounting for the equilibrium expected return, what is left is unpredictable.',
  method: 'A literature review. Fama organizes the evidence up to 1969: statistical tests of return predictability (serial correlation, runs tests, trading-rule "filters"), event studies of how quickly prices react to announcements such as stock splits and earnings, and studies of whether insiders or mutual fund managers earn abnormal returns.',
  example: '<p>Think of the three forms as three sets of clues. <b>Weak form</b>: only yesterday\'s prices. Can charts predict tomorrow\'s move? Tests said mostly no. <b>Semi-strong</b>: everything published, such as earnings and split announcements. Can you profit by trading after the news? Prices adjusted almost immediately. <b>Strong</b>: even secrets. Insiders and specialists may profit, but there was little evidence that outsiders, including mutual funds, could.</p>',
  findings: 'Weak-form evidence is strongly supportive: past returns say little about future returns. Semi-strong evidence, such as fast adjustment to public announcements, is also largely supportive.

  idea: 'In an efficient market, the price today is the best forecast of the "perfect-foresight" price p*: the present value of the dividends that actually get paid afterwards. Split p* into the forecast plus its error: p* = p + error, where the error (what nobody could have known yet) is unrelated to the forecast itself. Two things that do not move together have variances that simply add, the same rule behind the ρ = 0 row in the <a href="#/lesson/risk">risk lesson\'s</a> portfolio-variance table, so Var(p*) = Var(p) + Var(error) is automatically at least as large as Var(p) alone. A forecast, in other words, must be <em>calmer</em> than the thing it forecasts. So, if prices are rational forecasts, <b>Var(p) ≤ Var(p*)</b>.',
  method: 'Shiller constructs p* for the S&amp;P Composite index (from 1871) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (from 1928) using actual subsequent dividends, a constant discount rate and an assumption about the terminal value. Both series are detrended, and he compares the variance of actual prices to the variance of p*.',
  example: '<p>Imagine a share that will actually pay $5 a year for three years, and then be worth $100, with a 10% discount rate. Its perfect-foresight price at the start is 5 ÷ 1.10 + 5 ÷ 1.10² + 5 ÷ 1.10³ + 100 ÷ 1.10³ = 4.55 + 4.13 + 3.76 + 75.13 = <b>$87.57</b>. That is what the price "should" have been with hindsight. A real price in the market is a <em>forecast</em> made without knowing the future, so it has forecast errors that make p* wiggle around it. The forecast should be the smoother of the two. Shiller found the opposite.</p>',
  findings: 'Actual prices are far more volatile than the p* series: the variance bound is violated, and by a large margin. The ex-post rational price is smooth, while actual prices swing widely around it. Shiller\'s conclusion is that changes in dividends cannot plausibly account for the size of price movements.',
  matters: 'Kicked off the "excess volatility" literature and provided a key motivation for behavioral finance. It also pushed researchers to consider <em>time-varying expected returns</em> (Campbell–Shiller, Cochrane) as an explanation. Shiller shared the 2013 Nobel with Fama and Hansen.',
  critique: 'Kleidon (1986) and Marsh and Merton (1986) challenged the statistics: dividends and prices are not stationary around a deterministic trend, so the variance comparison may be biased; Flavin (1983) documented small-sample problems in variance-bound tests. The most important reply is conceptual: with <em>time-varying discount rates</em>, high price volatility can be consistent with rationality, which raises the joint-hypothesis problem again.',

Because the position is (almost) riskless, it must earn the ordinary risk-free rate, which is what fixes the option\'s price. For a call with S = K = $100, r = 3%, σ = 25% and half a year to expiry, the result is about <b>$7.76</b>.</p>',

  level: 'Accessible', min: 20, tags: ['asymmetric information', 'adverse selection'],
  plain: 'When you buy a used car, the seller knows more about it than you do. Because you cannot tell a good one from a bad one (a "lemon"), you will only pay an average price. But at an average price, owners of good cars refuse to sell, so the cars left for sale are worse than average, so buyers offer even less, and so on. The market can shrink dramatically or vanish, even though everyone would gain from trade.',

    ['Signal', 'something a seller does to credibly show quality, such as a warranty'],
    ['Unraveling', 'a market shrinking step by step until it collapses']
  ],
  question: 'What happens in a market where sellers know the quality of what they sell but buyers do not?',
  idea: 'If buyers cannot tell good from bad, they will pay only the <em>average</em> value. At that price, owners of good goods do not sell, so the average quality of what is offered falls, so buyers lower their offers further. This <b>adverse selection</b> spiral can shrink the market drastically or cause it to disappear entirely.',
  method: 'A simple theoretical model, built around used cars: "lemons" (bad cars) and good cars are indistinguishable to buyers. In the numerical example, car quality is spread evenly across a range, each seller will part with a car of quality <i>q</i> for any price of at least <i>q</i>, and every buyer values that car at 1.5 times <i>q</i>. So every car is worth more to a buyer than to its owner and trade should always be beneficial. Yet with hidden quality, no trade happens at any positive price. The rest of the paper applies the logic to other markets.',
  example: '<p>Follow the numbers. Suppose the price is $1,000. Only owners whose cars are worth $1,000 <em>or less</em> to them will sell, so the cars offered range from worthless up to $1,000, and their average value to owners is about $500. Buyers value a car at 1.5 times its quality, so an average car offered is worth 1.5 × $500 = $750 to a buyer, which is <em>less than</em> the $1,000 price. Buyers will not pay it. Try $800: the average car offered is worth $400 to its owner, or $600 to a buyer: still below the price. At any price p, the buyer\'s value of the average car offered is 0.75 × p, always below p. So no price works, and the market disappears.</p>',
  findings: 'With asymmetric information, trade that would benefit both parties may not occur. The bad drives out the good. Institutions such as warranties, brand names, licensing and chain stores can partly counteract the problem by signalling or guaranteeing quality. Applications include insurance for the elderly, discrimination in hiring and credit markets in developing countries.',
  matters: 'It founded the economics of information. Akerlof shared the 2001 Nobel Prize with Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz. Adverse selection is now central in finance: Myers and Majluf\'s pecking order (issuing equity signals a lemon), Stiglitz and Weiss\'s credit rationing (1981), and insurance markets.',
  critique: 'The extreme unraveling is a theoretical possibility rather than the norm, and real used-car markets function thanks to inspections, warranties and reputation. Some empirical tests, such as Bond (1982) on used pickup trucks, found little evidence of a lemons discount. That does not refute the model. It suggests the counteracting institutions Akerlof described are effective. Also, the core model is stark: no signaling and no repeated interaction (Akerlof discusses institutions that counteract the problem, but they are not part of the basic model).',

  ],
  question: 'Why do banks exist, why are they vulnerable to runs, and what can prevent runs?',
  idea: 'People are uncertain about when they will need cash. Productive investments take time and are costly to liquidate early. A bank provides <b>liquidity insurance</b>: it pools deposits, invests in long-term assets and lets depositors withdraw on demand. That contract improves welfare, but it creates two equilibria: in the good one only those who need money withdraw; in the bad one, everyone expects others to withdraw, so everyone runs, and the bank fails even if its assets are sound.',
  method: 'A three-period game-theoretic model with a large number of identical depositors who learn privately whether they need cash early. It compares an economy without banks, an optimal risk-sharing contract and the demand-deposit contract, then analyzes the equilibria under a first-come, first-served rule ("sequential service").',
  example: '<p>A tiny version. 100 depositors each put in $1, so the bank has $100 invested in a long-term project. Cashing out the project early only returns what was put in ($1 per $1). The bank promises early withdrawers a bit more than $1, say $1.25, because it expects only some of them to withdraw early. If it must pay $1.25 to each early withdrawer, then after 100 ÷ 1.25 = <b>80</b> depositors have been paid, the bank has no money left. Anyone at position 81 or later gets nothing. Knowing this, everyone wants to be in the first 80, so everyone runs at once. The run is a self-fulfilling prophecy, even though the project was sound.</p>',
  findings: 'The demand-deposit contract can deliver the optimal risk sharing, but it admits a self-fulfilling run equilibrium. <b>Deposit insurance</b>, or a policy such as suspending convertibility, can rule out the run equilibrium; if it works, it costs nothing in equilibrium because nobody runs.',
  matters: 'It is the reference model of financial fragility, applicable to bank runs, money market fund runs and modern versions such as runs on repo and on uninsured deposits (Northern Rock in 2007; Silicon Valley Bank in 2023). Diamond and Dybvig shared the 2022 Nobel Prize with Ben Bernanke.',

Fundamentals-based theories (Gorton, 1988) and global-games models (Goldstein and Pauzner, 2005) make runs depend on bank health.
