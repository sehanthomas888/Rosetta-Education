<p>This is the most important idea in finance. Almost every value in this course, a bond, a share, a project, even a whole company, is the answer to one question: <em>what is a stream of future money worth today?</em></p>

<h2>Why a dollar today beats a dollar later</h2>
<aside class="callout story"><b class="lab">Picture this</b>
<p>A friend offers you $1,000 today, or $1,000 in three years. Which do you take? Almost everyone says "today", and for three good reasons: you could <b>invest</b> it and have more than $1,000 in three years; <b>prices will probably rise</b>, so $1,000 later buys less; and a promise of future money is <b>uncertain</b>, because your friend might not pay.</p></aside>
<p>So a payment that arrives later is worth <em>less</em> than the same amount today. The question is how much less. To answer it, we first go forwards in time (growing money), then backwards (shrinking it).</p>

<h2>Going forward: compounding</h2>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">FV = PV × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>Each period your money is multiplied by (1 + r). Do that <i>n</i> times and you have multiplied by (1 + r) <i>n</i> times over. That is all the little raised <i>n</i> means. (New to exponents? See the <a href="#/lesson/math-basics">math primer</a>.)</p>
<dl class="syms"><dt>FV</dt><dd>future value: what it is worth at the end</dd><dt>PV</dt><dd>present value: what you put in today</dd><dt>r</dt><dd>return per period as a decimal (7% → 0.07)</dd><dt>n</dt><dd>number of periods</dd></dl>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>$1,000 at 7% for 3 years: 1,000 × 1.07 × 1.07 × 1.07 = <b>$1,225.04</b>. Year by year: $1,070 → $1,144.90 → $1,225.04. Each year's interest earns interest of its own.</p>
<p class="hook"><b class="lab">Remember it as</b>"Multiply by 1 + r, once per year."</p></div></div>
<details class="pause"><summary>Pause and try: $500 at 4% for 2 years</summary><p>500 × 1.04 × 1.04 = 500 × 1.0816 = <b>$540.80</b>.</p></details>
<aside class="callout mistake"><b class="lab">Common mistake</b><p>Multiplying the rate by the years (7% × 3 = 21%) instead of compounding. That gives $1,210, not $1,225.04. The gap grows fast over long periods: at 7% for 30 years, compounding turns $1,000 into about $7,612, whereas the "rate × years" shortcut gives only $3,100.</p></aside>
<aside class="callout"><b>Rule of 72.</b> Money doubles in roughly 72 ÷ r years when r is written as a percent. At 6%, about 12 years; at 9%, about 8. It is a shortcut, good for rates between about 4% and 15%.</aside>

<h2>Going backward: discounting</h2>
<p>Run compounding backwards and you get <b>discounting</b>: the value today of a payment you will receive later. The rate used this way is the <b>discount rate</b>. It is the return you require for waiting and for bearing risk. Riskier payments get a higher discount rate, so they are worth less today.</p>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>Divide by (1 + r) once for every period you have to wait. The longer the wait and the higher the rate, the less the future money is worth today.</p>
<dl class="syms"><dt>PV</dt><dd>what the future payment is worth today</dd><dt>FV</dt><dd>the amount you will receive later</dd><dt>r</dt><dd>discount rate: what you could earn elsewhere, plus a premium for risk</dd><dt>n</dt><dd>periods until you receive it</dd></dl>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>You are promised $1,225.04 in 3 years and the right discount rate is 7%. PV = 1,225.04 ÷ 1.07³ = 1,225.04 ÷ 1.225 = <b>$1,000</b>. It is the same example as above, run in reverse.</p>
<p class="hook"><b class="lab">Remember it as</b>"Waiting shrinks money: divide once per year of waiting."</p></div></div>
<details class="pause"><summary>Pause and try: $2,000 in 5 years at 8%</summary><p>PV = 2,000 ÷ 1.08<sup>5</sup> = 2,000 ÷ 1.4693 = <b>$1,361.17</b>. You would be equally happy with $1,361 today or $2,000 in five years, if 8% is the right rate for you.</p></details>

<h2>Several payments: net present value</h2>
<p>A project usually costs money now and pays back over time. To judge it, shrink every payment to today's money and add them up. Money you pay out counts as negative. The total is the <b>net present value</b>.</p>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">NPV = Σ C<sub>t</sub> ÷ (1 + r)<sup>t</sup> &nbsp; (including the up-front cost as a negative C<sub>0</sub>)</div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>Take each cash flow, shrink it to today's money for the time you wait, and add everything up (that is what Σ means). Cash you pay out counts as negative. If the total is positive, the project earns more than your required return.</p>
<dl class="syms"><dt>C<sub>t</sub></dt><dd>cash flow in year <i>t</i> (negative if you pay, positive if you receive)</dd><dt>t</dt><dd>the year (0 = today, so no shrinking)</dd><dt>r</dt><dd>discount rate</dd></dl>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>Pay $1,000 today; receive $600 at the end of year 1 and $600 at the end of year 2; r = 10%. NPV = −1,000 + 600÷1.10 + 600÷1.21 = −1,000 + 545.45 + 495.87 = <b>+$41.32</b>. Positive, so accept.</p>
<p class="hook"><b class="lab">Remember it as</b>"Shrink every cash flow to today, add them, subtract the cost. Positive = worth doing."</p></div></div>
<p><b>The decision rule:</b> NPV &gt; 0 means the project is worth more than it costs, so do it. NPV &lt; 0 means walk away. NPV = 0 means you would earn exactly your required return.</p>

<h2>Level payments: annuities and perpetuities</h2>
<p>Loans, mortgages, pensions and bonds pay the same amount again and again. Adding up many discounted payments one by one would be slow, so there are shortcuts.</p>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">PV of an annuity = C × [ 1 − (1 + r)<sup>−n</sup> ] ÷ r</div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>An <b>annuity</b> pays the same amount <i>C</i> at the end of each year for <i>n</i> years. The formula adds up all the discounted payments for you. The bracket is the "annuity factor": what $1 a year for <i>n</i> years is worth today.</p>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>$100 a year for 5 years at 6%: factor = [1 − 1.06<sup>−5</sup>] ÷ 0.06 = (1 − 0.7473) ÷ 0.06 = 4.2124. PV = 100 × 4.2124 = <b>$421.24</b>. (Adding the five discounted payments one at a time gives the same answer.)</p></div></div>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">PV of a perpetuity = C ÷ r</div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>A <b>perpetuity</b> pays the same amount every year forever. Its value is the size of the pot that would earn exactly that payment as interest.</p>
<dl class="syms"><dt>C</dt><dd>the yearly payment (first one a year from now)</dd><dt>r</dt><dd>discount rate</dd></dl>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>$50 a year forever at 5%: 50 ÷ 0.05 = <b>$1,000</b>. Check: $1,000 in a 5% account earns $50 a year, forever, without touching the $1,000.</p>
<p class="hook"><b class="lab">Remember it as</b>"Payment ÷ rate."</p></div></div>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">PV of a growing perpetuity = C ÷ (r − g)</div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>Same idea, but the payment grows by <i>g</i> each year. Growth partly cancels the discounting, so the effective rate is <i>r</i> minus <i>g</i>. This is the <b>Gordon growth model</b>, the simplest way to value a stock as the present value of its dividends. It only works if <i>g</i> is less than <i>r</i>.</p>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>Next year's dividend is $2, growing 3% a year; you require 8%. Value = 2 ÷ (0.08 − 0.03) = 2 ÷ 0.05 = <b>$40</b>.</p>
<p class="hook"><b class="lab">Remember it as</b>"Payment ÷ (rate minus growth)."</p></div></div>
<aside class="callout mistake"><b class="lab">Common mistakes</b><ul>
<li><b>Mixing units.</b> If payments are monthly, use a <em>monthly</em> rate and count months. A 12% annual rate is about 1% per month, and 5 years is 60 months.</li>
<li><b>Mixing real and nominal.</b> Use a real (after-inflation) rate with real cash flows, or a nominal rate with nominal cash flows, never one of each.</li>
<li><b>Getting the timing wrong.</b> The formulas here assume each payment arrives at the <em>end</em> of its period.</li>
</ul></aside>

<h2>Why it matters for the rest of the course</h2>
<p>When Shiller asks whether stock prices are "too volatile", he compares them to the present value of later dividends. When Modigliani and Miller talk about the "cost of capital", they mean the discount rate. Almost every debate in asset pricing is really a debate about <em>which discount rate to use and why it changes</em>.</p>

<p>Investing means accepting uncertainty in exchange for a higher <em>expected</em> return. This lesson answers three questions: how do we measure risk, why does mixing assets reduce it, and how do we judge whether the extra return is worth the risk?</p>

<h2>Same average, very different ride</h2>
<aside class="callout story"><b class="lab">Picture this</b>
<p>Investment A returns exactly 6% every year. Investment B returns −14%, +26%, −14%, +26% in four years. Both average 6%. But you would sleep well with A and not with B. Averages hide the bumpiness. The bumpiness is what finance calls <b>risk</b>.</p></aside>
<p>We measure it with <b>volatility</b>, the standard deviation of returns (see the <a href="#/lesson/math-basics">math primer</a>). A never strays from its average, so its volatility is 0. B is always 20 points away from its average of 6%, so its volatility is <b>20%</b>. Higher volatility, same average: B has to offer a higher expected return to be worth holding.</p>

<h2>Combining assets</h2>
<p>A <b>portfolio</b> is everything you hold together. Its expected return is simply the weighted average of the parts.</p>
<div class="example"><b class="lab">Example</b><p>You put 60% in stocks (expected return 8%) and 40% in bonds (3%). What is the portfolio's expected return?</p>
<b class="lab sol">Solution</b><p>0.60 × 8% + 0.40 × 3% = 4.8% + 1.2% = <b>6.0%</b>.</p></div>
<p>Risk does <em>not</em> combine so simply, and that is the good news.</p>

<h2>Why mixing reduces risk</h2>
<aside class="callout story"><b class="lab">Picture this</b>
<p>Two stocks, A and B, over four years. A returns +20%, −10%, +20%, −10%. B does the opposite: −10%, +20%, −10%, +20%. Each averages 5% and each is bumpy (volatility 15%). Now put half your money in each. Year 1: (20 − 10) ÷ 2 = 5%. Year 2: (−10 + 20) ÷ 2 = 5%. Every year is 5%. The ups and downs cancelled perfectly: volatility zero, expected return unchanged.</p></aside>
<p>That perfect cancelling only happens when the assets move in exact opposites (<b>correlation ρ = −1</b>). In the real world assets are somewhere between opposites and twins, so mixing reduces risk without removing it. The formula below tells you exactly how much.</p>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">σ<sub>p</sub>² = w²σ<sub>A</sub>² + (1−w)²σ<sub>B</sub>² + 2·w·(1−w)·ρ·σ<sub>A</sub>·σ<sub>B</sub></div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>Portfolio variance has three parts: asset A's own risk, asset B's own risk, and a <b>teamwork term</b> that depends on how the two move together. The teamwork term is the one that changes with correlation ρ. The lower ρ is, the smaller that term, and the safer the portfolio. Take the square root at the end to get volatility back in percent.</p>
<dl class="syms"><dt>w</dt><dd>weight (share of the portfolio) in asset A; (1 − w) is the weight in B</dd><dt>σ<sub>A</sub>, σ<sub>B</sub></dt><dd>volatility of each asset</dd><dt>ρ</dt><dd>correlation between A and B (−1 to +1)</dd><dt>σ<sub>p</sub></dt><dd>volatility of the whole portfolio (σ<sub>p</sub>² is its variance)</dd></dl>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>60% stocks (σ = 18%), 40% bonds (σ = 6%), ρ = 0.2. Stocks' term: 0.6² × 18² = 116.6. Bonds' term: 0.4² × 6² = 5.8. Teamwork: 2 × 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.2 × 18 × 6 = 10.4. Variance = 132.8; σ<sub>p</sub> = √132.8 = <b>11.5%</b>. The simple weighted average of the volatilities would be 0.6 × 18 + 0.4 × 6 = 13.2%, so diversification saved <b>1.7 points</b> of risk for free.</p>

<p>Here is the same 60/40 mix as the correlation changes:</p>
<table class="simple"><thead><tr><th>Correlation ρ</th><th>Portfolio volatility</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>+1.0</td><td>13.2%</td><td>No benefit: just the weighted average</td></tr>
<tr><td>+0.2</td><td>11.5%</td><td>The worked example</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>11.1%</td><td>Unrelated assets</td></tr>
<tr><td>−0.5</td><td>9.8%</td><td>Strong benefit</td></tr>
<tr><td>−1.0</td><td>8.4%</td><td>Maximum benefit (with other weights it could reach 0)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Only when ρ = +1 does portfolio volatility equal the simple weighted average. For any ρ &lt; 1 it is <em>lower</em>, while expected return remains the weighted average (6% in the example). That gap is the closest thing finance has to a free lunch. The widget below has a <b>Show the math</b> panel that computes these three terms as you move the sliders.</p>
<p>At the extreme ρ = −1, the three-part variance formula collapses to just (w·σ<sub>A</sub> − (1−w)·σ<sub>B</sub>)² (the "teamwork" term becomes a perfect match for the two "own risk" terms, so they combine into one squared difference instead of three separate pieces). Volatility is the square root of that, so it hits exactly zero when the two pieces inside are equal: w·σ<sub>A</sub> = (1−w)·σ<sub>B</sub>. Solving for w gives the zero-risk weight: <b>w = σ<sub>B</sub> ÷ (σ<sub>A</sub> + σ<sub>B</sub>)</b>, so the riskier asset always gets the smaller weight.</p>
<details class="pause"><summary>Pause and try: which ρ helps most?</summary><p>The lowest one. Every step from +1 towards −1 shrinks the teamwork term, so risk falls. ρ = −1 gives the largest reduction.</p></details>
<details class="pause"><summary>Pause and try: the zero-risk weight</summary><p>σ<sub>A</sub> = 20%, σ<sub>B</sub> = 10%, ρ = −1. w = 10 ÷ (20 + 10) = <b>33.3%</b> in A, 66.7% in B. Check: 0.333 × 20 = 6.67, and 0.667 × 10 = 6.67. They match, so volatility is zero.</p></details>

<h2>Two kinds of risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk</b>: a factory fire, a failed drug trial. It is independent across companies, so diversification washes it out. A portfolio of a few dozen stocks removes most of it.</li>
<li><b>Systematic (market) risk</b>: recessions, rate shocks, pandemics. It hits everything at once and cannot be diversified away.</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction is the whole basis of the CAPM: since idiosyncratic risk is free to remove, the market should not pay you for bearing it.</p>
<aside class="callout mistake"><b class="lab">Common mistake</b><p>Thinking diversification makes you safe from losses. It removes only the risk that is special to individual holdings. A well-diversified portfolio still falls in a market crash, and correlations often <em>rise</em> in crises (2008 is the standard example), which is when you need the protection most.</p></aside>

<p>Textbooks tell you what economists concluded. Papers show you <em>how</em> they concluded it, and where the conclusion could be wrong. Finance papers look intimidating, but nearly all of them follow the same skeleton, and you do not have to follow every derivation to learn a great deal from one. If the notation is what worries you, read the <a href="#/lesson/math-basics">math primer</a> first.</p>

<h2>The skeleton of a paper</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Abstract and introduction:</b> the question, the answer, and why it matters, in plain language.</li>
<li><b>Theory or model:</b> the argument, often with equations. You can skim this on a first read.</li>
<li><b>Data:</b> what was measured, where it came from, and over which years.</li>
<li><b>Results:</b> tables and figures showing what was found. This is the evidence.</li>
<li><b>Robustness and conclusion:</b> attempts to break the result, and what the authors take from it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The three-pass method</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Pass 1: skim (10 minutes).</b> Read the title, abstract, introduction and conclusion, and look at every figure. Goal: write one sentence stating the question and one stating the claimed answer.</li>
<li><b>Pass 2: read (45 to 60 minutes).</b> Read the model or data section and the main tables. Skip derivations you cannot follow. Goal: know what evidence was used and what the headline result looks like <em>as a number</em>.</li>
<li><b>Pass 3: interrogate.</b> Ask what would have to be true for the result to be wrong. Read the robustness section, then search for the papers that cite this one; the critiques usually live there.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Six questions to ask every paper</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>What is the question?</b> If you cannot say it in a sentence, keep skimming.</li>
<li><b>What is the claim?</b> What would we observe in the world if it were true?</li>
<li><b>What is the evidence?</b> Which data, which years, which universe of assets? ("NYSE stocks, 1963 to 1991" is a very specific claim.)</li>
<li><b>How big is the effect in real-world terms?</b> A 0.5% monthly return is large. A 0.02% return that disappears after trading costs is not.</li>
<li><b>What else could explain it?</b> Risk? Mispricing? Data quirks? Luck?</li>
<li><b>Does it survive out of sample?</b> In later years, other countries, other asset classes?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Is it luck? The t-statistic</h2>
<div class="fx"><div class="formula">t = estimate ÷ standard error</div><div class="fx-body">
<p><b class="lab">In plain English</b>The <b>t-statistic</b> asks: "how many times bigger is the result than its own noise?" The standard error is a measure of the noise (the uncertainty in the estimate). Rule of thumb: if |t| is above about 2, the result is unlikely to be pure chance.</p>
<p class="ex"><b class="lab">Worked example</b>A strategy earned an average 0.60% a month with a standard error of 0.25%. t = 0.60 ÷ 0.25 = <b>2.4</b>, so probably not luck. If the standard error were 0.50%, t = 1.2 and you could not tell it from luck.</p>

<details class="pause"><summary>Pause and try: estimate 0.9, standard error 0.3</summary><p>t = 0.9 ÷ 0.3 = <b>3</b>. That is comfortably above 2, so the result is unlikely to be luck. (By itself it does not say the result is large or useful, only that it is probably not noise.)</p></details>

<h2>Finance-specific red flags</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Data mining (the "factor zoo").</b> If hundreds of variables are tested, some will look significant by chance. Harvey, Liu and Zhu (2016) argue new factors should clear a t-statistic of about 3, not the usual 2.</li>
<li><b>Publication decay.</b> McLean and Pontiff (2016) studied 97 published return predictors and found returns were about 26% lower out of sample and about 58% lower after publication.</li>
<li><b>The joint hypothesis problem.</b> Any test of "are prices rational?" also tests a specific model of what expected returns <em>should</em> be. You cannot separate the two.</li>
<li><b>Survivorship and look-ahead bias.</b> Using only firms or funds that still exist, or using information that was not yet public at the time.</li>
<li><b>Ignoring costs.</b> Paper profits that need constant trading in tiny, illiquid stocks often vanish in practice.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout mistake"><b class="lab">Common mistake</b><p>Treating "statistically significant" as "important". With enough data, tiny effects become significant. Always look at the <em>size</em> of the effect, and ask whether it would survive real-world costs.</p></aside>

<p>The <a href="#/lesson/risk">risk lesson</a> ended with a big idea: some risk can be removed for free by diversifying.

<aside class="callout mistake"><b class="lab">Common mistake</b><p>Reading beta as "how risky the stock is overall". Beta measures only <em>market</em> risk. A tiny biotech company can be hugely risky by itself (large idiosyncratic risk) and still have a modest beta. CAPM says the market pays you only for the beta part.</p></aside>

<h2>Does it work?</h2>
<p>Partly. The core insight that only systematic risk earns a premium shaped all of modern finance. But the empirical line is flatter than the theory predicts: low-beta stocks have earned more than CAPM says, and high-beta stocks less. Roll (1977) also pointed out that the true "market portfolio" includes every asset, so the model can never really be tested. Multi-factor models such as <a href="#/lesson/p-ff93">Fama–French</a> emerged to explain what beta alone misses.</p>

  takeaways: [
    'CAPM prices only systematic risk: expected return = risk-free + β × market premium.',
    'Beta measures sensitivity to the market: 1 is the market itself, above 1 amplifies it, below 1 dampens it.',
    'Points above the security market line have positive alpha, and points below have negative alpha.',
    'Empirically the line is flatter than the theory predicts. That gap motivated multi-factor models.'
